# but this functionality is absorbed in eris-db, eris-cm, eris-cli
# and the mapping is preserved here to catch deployed use-cases.
# NOTE: eris-db serve picks up following environment variables which are relevant to interaction with eris-cli
#  - CHAIN_ID, set by eris-cli
#  - ERIS_DB_WORKDIR, set in this script
#  - ERIS_DB_DATADIR, set in this script
#  - ERISDB_API (to be deprecated in favor of explicit --disable-rpc)
#  - CONFIG_OPTS, for arbitrary flags to be passed to `eris-db serve`
