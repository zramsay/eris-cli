# Jobs Specification

Jobs are defined in **job definition files**.

Action definition files are formatted in `yaml` and default file is `epm.yaml`.

Examples of eris job definition files are available in the [jobs_fixtures directory](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris/tree/master/tests/jobs_fixtures).

Each job will perform its required action and then it will save the result of its job in a variable which can be utilized by jobs later in the sequence using eris:jobs' [variable specification](/docs/specs/variable_specification).

# Jobs

Jobs are performed as sequentially based on the order they are given in the jobs definition file. By default eris:jobs will perform the entire sequence of jobs which has been outlined in a given jobs file.

Job categories are categorize into:

* transaction jobs
* contracts jobs]
* test jobs
* other jobs

// TODO clean this up (RJ)

For each job which is specified, EPM will parse the following information:

{{ insert_definition "package.go" "Jobs" }}

Each job must then specify one **and only one** key which will determine the `type` of job which eris:jobs should run. It is not invalid to add additional jobs, but only one of the jobs will be ran by eris:jobs. The jobs and their purposes are outlined in the Job struct.

{{ insert_definition "package.go" "Job" }}
