Do these things before you ship:

- documentation -> preferably auto generated and placed into an appropriate place in https://docs.erisindustries.com . (for how to autogenerate for go tools, see eris-cli repository)
- tests -> tests should include instructions for [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/docs) to reproduce the tests as appropriate
- specification (if appropriate // where you give users choices // where you want folks to be able to plug in) -> preferably auto generated and placed into an appropriate place in https://docs.erisindustries.com
- Dockerfile
- README,d -> WTF is this? How do I install it? What am I looking at? Who's crap is this? [Wat?](http://www.darwinbiler.com/designing-and-making-the-readme-file-for-your-github-repository/) See NodeGuy's [Make a Smooth On-Ramp for your Project](http://www.nodeguy.com/make-a-smooth-on-ramp-for-your-project/).
- license -> GPL3 is preferred and should be your default starting point; to use other licenses, speak to the marmot leadership
