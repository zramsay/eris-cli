package update

import (
//	"testing"
)

// TODO unit testing!
// [zr] unsure how to mock update tests;
// such that things don't break

// gitandgo.go -> everything in there is super stable
// binary.go -> functions have too much hardcoded them to be tested...? 

// perform/perform.go -> test for DockerBuild()

// could write a test via bash script that uses `docker-machine scp/ssh` combo
// and is run independently of unit tests, via the tests/tests_scripts.sh
